"""
hatch_build.py — custom Hatchling build hook for gedcom-dna-finder.

Runs automatically during `python -m build dev/ --outdir dist/`.

What it does
------------
1. Copies every *.py file from src/ into gedcom_dna_finder/_scripts/ so the
   GUI and CLI entry-point shims can find them at runtime after pip install.
2. Copies docs/ and icons/ into the package so _resource_path() in the GUI
   resolves correctly (it looks two directories above __file__, which is
   gedcom_dna_finder/_scripts/, landing on gedcom_dna_finder/).
3. The static [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include] entry in
   pyproject.toml then picks up the entire gedcom_dna_finder/ tree.
4. Cleans up the temporary copies after the wheel is written so the working
   tree stays tidy.

Note: this file lives in dev/ alongside pyproject.toml.  self.root is
therefore the absolute path to dev/, and the repo root is self.root's parent.
