# Builds a wheel + sdist and uploads them to PyPI via Twine.
# Run from any directory; the script repositions to the repo root.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Python 3.8+ in PATH (or activate the project venv first)
#   - PyPI credentials in ~/.pypirc, or set TWINE_USERNAME / TWINE_PASSWORD,
#     or be prepared to enter them interactively.
#
# Usage:
#   ./dev/build-pypi.sh             # build + upload to PyPI
#   ./dev/build-pypi.sh --test-pypi # build + upload to test.pypi.org
