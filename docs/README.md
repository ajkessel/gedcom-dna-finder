# GEDCOM DNA Finder

This tool provides useful ways to explore a GEDCOM file exported from services
like Ancestry, MyHeritage, Geni, and Family Tree Maker:

* Find the closest DNA-flagged person to any other person in a family tree
* Show multiple relationship paths between any two people in your tree
* Search your tree for variations on names and filter on other information like
  geographical locations
* Rapidly explore names and connections in your tree

Available as a graphical tool as well as a command-line version.

This is an alpha release. Only one person has tested it so far--me. If you are
interested in experimenting with a "dummy" GEDCOM file rather than your own,
several are available from [https://github.com/findmypast/gedcom-samples](the
findmypast GitHub repository). I used the [Game of Thrones family
tree](https://github.com/findmypast/gedcom-samples/blob/main/GoT.ged) for the
sample screenshots to avoid any privacy issues and also to show why it's a bad
idea for siblings to marry one another.

## The problems this solves

Many genealogists working with autosomal DNA add unfamiliar people to their
family tree based on DNA matches and then build out those people's lines, hoping
to find the most recent common ancestor between the match and themselves. After
accumulating thousands of these speculative additions, you often end up looking
at a person in your tree and thinking: *why is this person here? which DNA match
did this branch come from?*

Ancestry, Family Tree Maker, and other standard GEDCOM viewers show you a flat
list of everyone you've tagged as a DNA match, but none of them will, given an
arbitrary person in the tree, walk outward through the relationship graph and
tell you the nearest tagged relative. That is the main purpose of this tool.

You can also use this tool to find multiple paths between any two people in your
tree and also view individual records from your tree. For example, if your
grandfather's maternal cousin married your grandfather's paternal cousin, you
will have multiple paths to their descendants. Most applications only show one
path; this tool can find as many paths as you like.

If you set a person as the "Home Person" using the "Set Home" button, the
results will always include the path from the selected person to the Home Person
in addition to the closest people with DNA match markers.

Finally, if you have a large tree, you may find it difficult to search for
specific individuals in other tools. Ancestry, for example, only searches on the
person's "preferred name" and not any of the alternate names, and neither
Ancestry nor Family Tree Maker allow fuzzy matching searches. Ancestry also
does not allow you to easily search on multiple fields, like name and location.
With this tool, you can search for a name with fuzzy matching (e.g. "John Smith"
in the "Find:" box) and then further limit the results by a term that appears
anywhere in the person's record (e.g. "Chicago" in the "Filter" box). If you
have multiple names in a person's record (e.g. maiden name and married name),
this tool will match either one. This search method avoids the clumsy
workarounds people use to label people in their tree, for example, by packing
all the person's different surnames into the surname field. You can create a
separate "name" record for each name the person has, and then find them easily
using this tool's search functionality.

## What it does

![Main
window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajkessel/gedcom-dna-finder/main/docs/screenshots/main-window.png)

Given a GEDCOM file and a target individual, the tool performs a breadth-first
search through the tree's relationship graph (parents, children, siblings,
spouses) and returns the closest individuals flagged as DNA matches, along with
the relationship path connecting each match to the target.

Two flag formats are recognized out of the box:

- **AncestryDNA citations.** When an Ancestry-managed tree marks a person as a
  DNA match, the exported GEDCOM contains a source citation with a `PAGE` line
  of the form:
  ```
  2 PAGE AncestryDNA Match to Jane Q. Doe
  ```
- **MyTreeTags / Family Tree Maker custom tags.** Tags applied via Ancestry
  MyTreeTags or as a custom fact in Family Tree Maker show up as a pointer to a
  tag-definition record:
  ```
  1 _MTTAG @T182059@
  ```
  with the corresponding definition elsewhere in the file:
  ```
  0 @T182059@ _MTTAG
  1 NAME DNA Match
  ```

Both substrings are configurable, so you can adapt the tool to other genealogy
software's conventions.

Although this software was developed for this DNA use case, you could use it to
find the closest path to any tag or page marker by entering that string into
"tag keyword" or "page marker" rather than a DNA-specific term. For example, if
your paternal relatives are tagged with a "paternal" tag, you could use this
tool to find the path between anyone in your tree and anyone tagged as a
paternal relative.

## Requirements

The pre-built executables have no requirements.

If you want to run these scripts from the source code, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Tkinter (only for the GUI). It ships with the official Python installers on
  Windows and macOS. On most Linux distributions it is in a separate package,
  typically `python3-tk`.

No third-party libraries; the entire tool uses only the Python standard library.

## Installation

### Pre-built executables

Download the [latest release for your operating
system](https://github.com/ajkessel/gedcom-dna-finder/releases/latest). No
Python installation required.

### pip (PyPI)

This application is also available on [PyPI via
pip](https://pypi.org/project/gedcom-dna-finder/). Use this command to install:
```
pip install gedcom-dna-finder
```

After installation two commands are available:

| Command                 | Description            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `gedcom-dna-finder`     | Command-line interface |
| `gedcom_dna_finder_gui` | Graphical interface    |

The GUI requires Tkinter, which ships with the official Python installers on
Windows and macOS. On most Linux distributions it is in a separate package:

```
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install python3-tk

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# Arch
sudo pacman -S tk
```

### Run from source

```
git clone https://github.com/ajkessel/gedcom-dna-finder.git
cd gedcom-dna-finder
python src/gedcom_dna_finder_gui.py        # GUI
python src/gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py --help # CLI
```

No third-party libraries are needed to run from source.

### Build executables yourself

Use [build.sh](../dev/build.sh) to compile for Linux or Mac and
[build.ps1](../dev/build.ps1) for Windows. The build script automatically
creates a Python virtual environment and installs the required dependencies.
These dependencies are only needed for building, not for running from source.

A [build-and-release.sh](../dev/build-and-release.sh) script is also available
that builds for all three platforms under WSL.

## Usage

For pre-built binaries, just run the executable. 

### Relationship finder

This is an alternate use of this tool. Select a person in the search panel, then
click on "Find Relationship Path..." and select a second person. This tool will
then show you the top three paths (if they exist) between those two people. You
can change the number of paths to an arbitrary number by editing the "Top N"
value in the bottom right. If the two people are very distantly related, you may
need to increase the "Max Depth" setting to find the connection. The default max
depth of 50 should find connections at least up to 4th cousins.

![Relationship
window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajkessel/gedcom-dna-finder/main/docs/screenshots/relationship-path.png)


### GUI

```
python gedcom_dna_finder_gui.py                  # opens with no file loaded
python gedcom_dna_finder_gui.py /path/to/tree.ged   # auto-loads on startup
```

1. Click **Browse** and select your `.ged` file (or pass it on the command line
   as shown above). The tool will also find a `.ged` file inside a `.zip` file,
   since a tree downloaded from Ancestry will be zipped.
2. Optionally adjust the tag keyword (default `DNA`) or page marker (default
   `AncestryDNA Match`). The defaults work for files exported from Ancestry and
   Family Tree Maker.
3. Click **Load**. The status bar will show how many individuals, families, and
   DNA-flagged people were found.
4. Type a name or INDI ID into the search box to filter the people list. Names
   are matched by whitespace-separated tokens, in any order, each as a
   case-insensitive substring — so `John Smith` will find `John Adam Smith`. The
   "DNA-flagged only" checkbox hides everyone else.
5. Select a person and click **Find Nearest DNA Matches** (or just double-click
   the row).
6. The right pane shows the closest flagged relative(s) and the relationship
   path from the selected person to each one.

![Results pane showing a relationship
path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajkessel/gedcom-dna-finder/main/docs/screenshots/results-pane.png)

The **View tag definitions...** button opens a window listing every `_MTTAG`
record in the file with its name, which is useful for deciding what tag-keyword
filter to use.

### Command line

```
# List all _MTTAG definitions in the file (use "_" as a placeholder for the target)
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged --list-tags _

# List every flagged individual
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged --list-flagged _

# Find the three nearest DNA-flagged relatives by name
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged "Jane Doe"

# Names are matched by whitespace-separated tokens, in any order, each as
# a case-insensitive substring. The middle name is not required:
# this matches "John Adam Smith".
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged "John Smith"

# Fuzzy matching tolerates typos and spelling variants. The default
# similarity threshold is 0.6; raise it for stricter matches.
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged "John Smth" --fuzzy
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged "John Smth" --fuzzy --fuzzy-threshold 0.75

# Find by exact INDI ID
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged @I1234@

# Restrict the tag filter to actual DNA matches only (excludes
# "DNA Connection" or "Common DNA Ancestor" if you use those tags)
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged "Jane Doe" --tag-keyword "DNA Match"

# Return the top 5 nearest matches with a deeper search
python gedcom_dna_finder_cli.py tree.ged "Jane Doe" --top 5 --max-depth 80
```

## Important caveat for Ancestry users

Ancestry's GEDCOM export is well known to be lossy and its handling of
MyTreeTags has varied across versions. If this tool reports far fewer flagged
individuals than you expected, load the file and click **View tag
definitions...** (or run `--list-tags _` from the command line) to confirm
whether your tag records actually made it into the export. If they did not, the
workarounds are:

1. Sync the Ancestry tree to Family Tree Maker, add a custom fact (for example,
   named `DNA Match`) on those individuals in FTM, then export the GEDCOM from
   FTM. Custom facts in FTM survive the GEDCOM export reliably.
2. Or rely on the `2 PAGE AncestryDNA Match to ...` citation, which *is*
   generated automatically by Ancestry when you tag a person as a DNA match
   while building their tree from a match's profile.

Run the tool with `--list-flagged _` (CLI) or use the "DNA-flagged only"
checkbox (GUI) right after loading to confirm the flagged set looks complete
before drawing conclusions from any individual query.

## How "closest" is defined

The tool measures distance as the number of edges traversed in the GEDCOM
relationship graph. Each of the following counts as one edge:

- parent ↔ child
- sibling ↔ sibling (within the same `FAM` record)
- spouse ↔ spouse

This means a sibling and a parent are treated as equidistant from ego (both are
one edge away), which fits the practical question "how many hops do I need to
figure out why this person is in my tree" but is not the same as a genealogical
relationship coefficient.

## Limitations and notes

- Edge weighting is uniform, as described above. If you would prefer to weight
  blood relationships and marriages differently, the `neighbors()` function is
  the place to change it.
- The BFS stops as soon as it has accumulated `--top` matches at shortest
  distances. It does not guarantee a globally optimal cover of *all* equally
  close matches if there is a tie at the boundary — raise `--top` if you suspect
  ties.
- Custom tags whose names happen to contain the substring `DNA` will also be
  picked up under the default `--tag-keyword`. Use a more specific keyword, such
  as `"DNA Match"`, if you want to exclude Ancestry's `DNA Connection` and
  `Common DNA Ancestor` tags.
- The tool does not write back to your GEDCOM and does not phone home; it reads
  the file and prints results.
- Tested with GEDCOM 5.5.1 files exported from Ancestry and Family Tree Maker.
  Files from other software should work as long as they use standard `INDI` /
  `FAM` / `HUSB` / `WIFE` / `CHIL` structures and one of the two recognized flag
  formats (or a substitute that you configure via `--tag-keyword` and
  `--page-marker`).

## Privacy

The tool runs entirely locally on your machine. Nothing is uploaded. Be aware,
however, that your `.ged` file likely contains personal information about living
people; do not commit your real GEDCOM to a public repository or create issues
or provide feedback to this repository with any personal data.

## Windows security

You may get a warning from Windows Defender that this is an unrecognized app
from an unknown publisher. You can run the application by clicking first on
"more info" and then "run anyway." It should only ask the first time you execute
the software.

## MacOS security

If you are on Mac and not running from the source code, you will have to tell
the operating system manually to trust the program. As of 29 April 2026, I am
testing a new build process that should only require one click to approve after
downloading--just select "open" when presented with the box below the first time
you run a new version of the application.

### Old instructions

The instructions below apply to older versions of this application and hopefully
are no longer necessary.

1. Attempt to open the app (it will fail).
2. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security.
3. Scroll down to the "Security" section.
4. Click "Open Anyway" next to the notification about the blocked app. You will
   likely need to enter the username and password of an administrator user on
   the device to approve the application.

If you follow these steps and are seeing an error along the lines of "This file
is damaged and can't be opened" it is typically because a false positive from
your security settings. This can be fixed by opening the Terminal application
(via Applications->Utilities or Spotlight search), typing `xattr -cr ` (with a
space after `cr`) and then dragging and dropping the application ito the
Terminal window and hitting enter. This will remove the "quarantine" setting on
the application and allow you to run it again.
